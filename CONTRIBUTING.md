# Contributing

### 🔏 Signed Commits Required

All contributions to this project must use **signed commits**. This is an important part of our commitment to security, 
authenticity, and trust in the software we maintain. Signed commits prove that a commit actually came from you, not just 
someone who knows your name and email. Without signed commits, it’s possible for malicious actors to impersonate contributors 
and inject malicious code into the project. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unsigned commits will be automatically rejected by our CI. If you forget to sign a commit, you can amend it using signature
> verification.

To learn more about commit signature verification and to make sure you're using signed commits, please read this 
[guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).

Thank you for helping us make the open-source community safer!
