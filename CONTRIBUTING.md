## Commits

### üîè Signed Commits Required

All contributions to this project must use **signed commits**. This is an important part of our commitment to security, 
authenticity, and trust in the software we maintain. Signed commits prove that a commit actually came from you, not just 
someone who knows your name and email. Without signed commits, it‚Äôs possible for malicious actors to impersonate contributors 
and inject malicious code into the project. 

**Unsigned commits will be automatically blocked by our CI.**

To learn more about commit signature verification and to make sure you're using signed commits, please read this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).
